My implementation of text twist with Svelte on the frontend and Flask on the backend

# Organization

- frontend: svelte iniviated using Vite
- backend: Python Flask app
- has a virtual environment called text_twist_venv (backend/text_twist_venv) containing all python dependencies

# Tomorrow To Do

- Twist shuffles the letters
- Clear removes the letters from the boxes
- guessing adds guess to particular box

# To Do List

- timer of 2 minutes
- shuffle letters
- skip button disabled when longest word has not been guessed
- skippable if longest=Ok
- SCORE tracker
- ROUND tracker
- Intersection observer that limits the num of words if the subwords intersect with the border of the card
- check the tempSettings store thing, might not be nec. anymore
